Ruby on Rails Assessment: Real-Time SMS Notification System with Rails 7
Objective:

Develop a feature within a Ruby on Rails application that demonstrates your skills in real-time
processing and integration, specifically focusing on SMS notifications - a key aspect consistent
with Teletask’s products.

Deliverables:
Provide:
1. a screen recording that shows you walking someone through your approach and solution
2. Your code with readme that describes how to build and run

Project Description:
Real-Time SMS Notification System
Create a module in a Ruby on Rails application that sends real-time SMS notifications in
response to a specific trigger (e.g., a new user sign-up, a certain threshold being met, etc.). This
module should make use of the latest Rails 7 features for backend processing and integrate
with an SMS API (like Twilio or ClickSend).

Key Features:
1. Trigger-Based Notifications:
 Set up a trigger within the application that initiates an SMS notification. This
could be a user action or a specific application state.

2. SMS API Integration:
 Integrate a third-party SMS API to send real-time notifications.
3. Rails 7 Backend Processing:
 Utilize Rails 7's latest features for backend processing related to the trigger and
notification logic.
4. Front-end Interface (Optional):
 Develop a simple interface to set up or monitor the triggers and notifications.
This part should be kept minimal to fit the time constraint.
